I'm a Computer Science student from Angelo State University in Texas and I mainly focus on web development. I love building and designing web applications.

I am a dedicated learner, especially to anything relating to web development. I have been learning Angular for 2 years and have developed some Angular web applications. Then, I decided to expand my knowledges to React. As I said,I love learning 😉. I have been making two react apps so far including this portfolio.
