Working as an Audio/Visual Supervisor of the Special Events Department of my school has allowed me to develop my ability to work collaboratively and communicate effectively. Even when the task is complicated, I always tried to make things clear and straightforward, so my team can understand and complete the job effectively.

My motivation at work is the result of our team and the customers' satisfaction after each event we handled. And I am proud to be recognized as the employee of the 2020-2021 academic year by my department.

Plus, I am multilingual (English, Vietnamese, French). Learning to speak another language really helps me expand my thought capability since it is more complex than memorizing new words and their proper pronunciation.
