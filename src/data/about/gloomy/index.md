I'm a digital Front End Developer hailing from living in Casablanca.I love working with modern technologies, building and designing awesome projects. I prefer minimalistic & clean designs with strong user experience.
behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.
